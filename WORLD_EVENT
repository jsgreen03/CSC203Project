1. The event is triggered by a mouse click.
2. When the event is triggered, eight tsunami waves should appear which are seen as obstacles by the entities.
   In the middle of the tsunmai waves, we created a sand "path" for the new entity to walk through. This new entity
   that appears after a mouse click is the seal which moves towards seaweed and destroys it.
3. As well as that, when the mouse is clicked and the tsunami waves appear, if a seagull goes next to the event,
   (next to a tsunmai wave) they will transform into a walking fish which drops seaweed until it reaches a sandcastle,
   where it transforms back into a seagull.
4. The new entity is a seal. It animates and moves towards the closest seaweed and destroys it.
5. The project was created by Amber Fry and Jaxon Green. Amber and Jaxon both worked on deciding a theme,finding the
   images, and converting them to gifs/bmp files together. Amber worked on creating the world event new entity,
   updating imagelist/ changing the images for the world to the new theme(background, new entities, old entities),
   and writing this text file. Jaxon was responsible for creating the world event visualization and creating the
   world event effect.
